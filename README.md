# My Portfolio Frontend with Next.js

Welcome to the repository for the frontend portion of my personal portfolio. This project is an exhilarating endeavor where I've decided to harness the power of Next.js to craft a more dynamic, modern, and enjoyable user experience.

This Next.js implementation is a refactoring of my original frontend, which was built using Nuxt.js 2 (you can find that codebase [here](https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-nuxtjs)). I felt that updating the Nuxt.js 3 version wasn't sparking joy, so I embarked on a journey to create something fresh with Next.js. The result is this project—sleek, fast, and ready to show off my work to the world.

## Live Backend

While this repository hosts the frontend, the backend services are up and running, and you can interact with them [here](https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-nodejs). The backend is critical to demonstrating the full capabilities of my portfolio, so feel free to check it out.

## Getting Started

To get this frontend up and running on your local development machine, ensure you have Node.js installed, and then follow the simple steps provided below.

### Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Damione1/portfolio-nextjs.git
cd portfolio-nextjs
```

Next, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start the development server and begin working on improvements or customization, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts the Next.js development server at `http://localhost:3000`. You can now edit the pages and components, with live reloading to show changes as you make them.

### Building for Production

When you’re ready to deploy your frontend, build the production-ready version with:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Starting the Production Server

After building, you can start the production server by running:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will launch the Next.js server in production mode, whereby your new, refactored frontend is now optimized and ready for visitors.
